        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Developed the migration of Radius ACS systems to Spring Boot, ensuring continuity of customer internet connectivity. The system stores and manages subscriber details such as IP addresses, MAC/OUI, static IPs, modems, and routers. Developed batch processes, REST APIs, SOAP Webservices for subscriber data management. Implemented Kafka messaging, External API integrations, and Logging to ensure reliability and scalability. Improved system efficiency and maintainability compared to the legacy platform.
